# CoScale-api-php

This repo has a collection of helper classes for PHP to help you communicate with our API via PHP.

There are also some examples to show you how to use the helper classes. Each file has extensive comments so be sure to take a look and read them carefully.

Right now we don't have a full SDK to help you with the code integration but we are investigating possibilities to generate SDKs for all popular languages based on our API.
